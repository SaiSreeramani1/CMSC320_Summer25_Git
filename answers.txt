Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

In order to save iterations of our code which we can later reference
or revert back to if needed.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Data Science could be applied to the field of machine learning where in order
to run and train models you need to first gather data which has to cleaned in 
order to provide accurate meaningful results. For example, if you want to
classify whether an image is a picture of a cat or dog, it's extremely
important to gather proper data of images of cats and dogs and with
data science we have to make sure the data set only contains clear images
which have distinctive features allowing machine learning models to provide
accurate results.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Merging takes two branches and preserves their full history with a merge
commit, while rebasing rewrites your branchâ€™s history to make it look like
your work happened after the latest changes.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Learning more about the field of data science and improving my Python skills.
